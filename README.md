# Study repository

This study will appear on https://epmg.netlify.app if **all** of the following are true:
  - it has a topic `tim-scenario`
  - GitHub Pages (under Settings => Pages) is enabled

By default, all such studies will appear in the "work in progress" section of that front page.

Whereas if you additionally give it the topic `recent`, it will appear in the "Recent" section.

But if you give it the topic `archive`, it will appear in the "Archive" section.
